# Machine Learning Regression Models
Examples of Machine Learning Regression Models Built in Python and R

These models are academic projects in Python and R to explore machine learning and its applications.

## Meet the Models

- Simple Linear  : Statistical model
- Muplie Linear  : Multiple linear regression (MLR), or simply as multiple regression: statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome. 
- Polynomial  : Relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y, modelled as an *nth* degree of x.
- Support Vector  (SVM): More often developed into a *machine* (SVM), maintains all the main features that characterize the algorithm (maximal margin).
- Decision Tree : *Data Mining* : Builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. 
- Random Forest : Supervised Learning algorithm which uses ensemble learning method for classification and regression

Each folder will have its sample data file, mostly a single comma-separated value spreadsheet, and it *Python* and *R* machine learning versions.
